About -intro- Romania is a southeastern European country known for the forested region of Transylvania, ringed by the Carpathian Mountains. Its preserved medieval towns include Sighişoara, and there are many fortified churches and castles, notably clifftop Bran Castle, long associated with the Dracula legend. Bucharest, the country’s capital, is the site of the gigantic, Communist-era Palatul Parlamentului government building – content taken from https://www.google.com/search?q=about+romania&spell=1&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwicm-6H-KrxAhU7QkEAHYaJDTIQBSgAegQIARAw&biw=1920&bih=969

Info castles “Romania's collection of castles and fortresses perhaps best illustrates the rich medieval heritage of the country. While castles built from the 14th to the 18th centuries are strong and austere fortresses built mainly for defense against invaders, those erected beginning in the late 1800s are imposing and luxurious. The most popular include the 14th century Corvin Castle, built on the site of a former Roman camp, the elegant 19th century Peles Castle with its 160 rooms filled with priceless European art and, of course, the Bran Castle, built in the mid-1300s and legendary home to Bram Stoker's Count Dracula. ” content taken from http://romaniatourism.com/castles-fortresses.html

Info monasteries- “During the invasions of migratory populations (barbarians), people found their shelter in front of the invaders, behind the fortified walls of the Monasteries, in the forests or caves surrounding the hermitages inhabited by the hermit monks. In order to celebrate important victories in battles, the Wallachian or Moldavian voivodes raised monasteries. In this way, the famous medieval monastery chain from Moldova and Bucovina was born. These monasteries, today under protection of UNESCO heritage, are known to be the oldest and best preserved Orthodox monasteries still in use!” content taken from - https://infocarpathia.com/the-faith-of-the-romanian-people/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw_dWGBhDAARIsAMcYuJyJIoa4ZAPVzgEcFfDKOVuNJi81ioNPB72tBOcOU0BxvSY-Wu5ZdQgaAuo5EALw_wcB
